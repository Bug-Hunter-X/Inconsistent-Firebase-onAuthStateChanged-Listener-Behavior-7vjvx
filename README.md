# Inconsistent Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Behavior

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` listener, where rapid authentication state changes can lead to missed updates.  The example code showcases a scenario where this inconsistency might occur, along with a proposed solution that improves reliability.

## Problem

The `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not reliably reflect the authentication state if the user logs in and out quickly. This can result in parts of your app not correctly responding to the authentication state.

## Solution

The improved solution adds more robust error handling and incorporates a debounce mechanism to avoid rapid-fire calls to the listener, ensuring that the most up-to-date state is consistently reflected.
