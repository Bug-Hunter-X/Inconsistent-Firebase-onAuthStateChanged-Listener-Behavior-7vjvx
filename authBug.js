The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener may not trigger as expected if the user's authentication state changes rapidly (e.g., during a quick succession of login/logout attempts). This can lead to missed state updates and unexpected behavior in your application.  Additionally, relying solely on `onAuthStateChanged` without proper error handling can leave your application vulnerable to silent failures.
